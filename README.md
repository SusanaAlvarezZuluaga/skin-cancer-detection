# Skin Cancer Detection using Python and Pytorch Lightning
- This project contains the code used to train different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to detect skin cancer in dermatoscopic images of skin lesions.
- The dataset used to train the networks can be found in the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000). 
- The architectures trained included: ResNet18, ResNet50 and RegYNet400
- WanDB was used to monitor the training process.
